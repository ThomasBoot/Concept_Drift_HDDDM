# Concept_Drift_HDDDM
An implementation of Hellinger-Distance Based Concept Drift Detection. Background reading is provided in `.\paper`.

## Reproducibility
1. Generate the Datasets used with the `GeneratingDatasets` file. 
2. Run `Main_HDDDM` for original results. 
3. Run `Main_HDDM_alternative` for results using two adaptations 2 and 3.
